TODO ideas for cvnirc-qt by canvon
==================================

 * Refactor the context stringification from the GUI to the core,
   so that the CLI can use it as well, and in a self-consistent way
   across all of cvnirc-qt.
   (2017-11-24)

 * Interpret protocol command names case-insensitively? That is,
   treat PRIVMSG and privmsg the same...
   (2017-11-24)

 * Have some output in the Main tab again (on a really high level); like
   creation/deletion of IRCProtoClient instances, contexts or the like.
   Perhaps also connection states without all the raw or partially-parsed
   lines in-between.
   (2017-11-20/-21)

 * Carry unique connection tag, so that the protocol buffer contents
   with two time the same/similar server connected will be meaningful.
   (2017-11-20/-21)

 * Have close tabs support. (Remove contexts? Have I refcounting for them?
   Skip Main tab (index 0).)
   (2017-11-23)

 * Have differently colored tabs depending on what input arrived there
   since last having a look.
   (2017-11-24)

 * Further test/improve the multi-server support.
   (2017-11-20/-21)

 * Modify cvnirc-cli, too, to use the multi-server supporting machinery.
   (2017-11-20/-21)

 * Have/support shorter timestamps, but this will likely require
   some kind of timer that outputs "day changed" messages now and then. ...
   (2017-11-23)

 * Automatic reconnects on disconnect.
   (2017-11-20/-21)
 
 * Automatic alternate nick generation when our choice gets rejected
   at connect time.
   (2017-11-20/-21)

 * Collect MOTD lines and pass the full MOTD as a multi-line text object,
   perhaps to be displayed in its own window tab.
   (2017-11-20/-21)

 * Have client-side interpreted user commands. (Like, /window close,
   perhaps? Or a /quit that exits the application... (?))
   (2017-11-20/-21)

 * Have colored nick names?
   (2017-11-24)

 * Save & restore settings, e.g., host/port/user/nick.
   (2017-11-20/-21)

 * SSL/TLS encryption. Both raw and on-demand?
   (2017-11-20/-21)

 * Implement logging?
   (2017-11-20/-21)

 * Implement scriptability, perhaps via dbus-connected script servers.
   (2017-11-20/-21)

 * Build and run on Mac? on Windows?
   (2017-11-23)

 * Have Continuous Integration builds for ~each commit?
   (2017-11-23)


cvnirc-gui:
-----------

 * Use the status bar?
   (2017-11-24)


cvnirc-cli:
-----------

 * Implement "chat support", that is, the ability to write a line of text
   and it being submitted automatically with some command to some target.
   Before, the cli is ~useless! ... Perhaps it can be done while integrating
   multi-server support...
   (2017-11-23)

 * Implement changing context via ^X, like Irssi does.
   (2017-11-24)

 * Dump raw protocol lines only on (to-be-implemented) -v or something?
   (2017-11-24)

 * When changing context is supported, automatically switch to new context
   when it gets created. This isn't implemented at the moment just because
   of fear of some query "hijacking" the prompt, with no possibility
   to go back...
   (2017-11-24)

 * Have a more helpful replacement for the missing readline7 function?
   Perhaps clear the line by outputting \r + spaces x (terminal width - 1)
   + \r?
   (2017-11-23)

 * Add custom completer to GNU readline UI.
