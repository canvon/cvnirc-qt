TODO ideas for cvnirc-qt by canvon
==================================

 * Have some output in the Main tab again (on a really high level); like
   creation/deletion of IRCProtoClient instances, contexts or the like.
   Perhaps also connection states without all the raw or partially-parsed
   lines in-between.
   (2017-11-20/-21)

 * Carry unique connection tag, so that the protocol buffer contents
   with two time the same/similar server connected will be meaningful.
   (2017-11-20/-21)

 * Further test/improve the multi-server support.
   (2017-11-20/-21)

 * Modify cvnirc-cli, too, to use the multi-server supporting machinery.
   (2017-11-20/-21)

 * Collect MOTD lines and pass the full MOTD as a multi-line text object,
   perhaps to be displayed in its own window tab.
   (2017-11-20/-21)

 * Have client-side interpreted user commands. (Like, /window close,
   perhaps? Or a /quit that exits the application... (?))
   (2017-11-20/-21)

 * Save & restore settings, e.g., host/port/user/nick.
   (2017-11-20/-21)

 * Implement logging?
   (2017-11-20/-21)

 * Implement scriptability, perhaps via dbus-connected script servers.
