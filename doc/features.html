            For switching channels in the GNU readline-based
            command-line interface, press ^O (that is, Ctrl-O).
            This is mostly the same as what Irssi does with ^X.
            It's possible to supply an "argument" or "count" to the
            cycle-context function, e.g., press Alt-- ^X (that is,
            Alt-minus or Esc minus followed by Ctrl-X) to go one step backwards
            instead of forward.
