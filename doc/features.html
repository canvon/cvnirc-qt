        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    IRC is presented to the user interfaces
                    (CLI, GUI) in the form of "contexts".
                    This can be a server context, which emits signals
                    when something w.r.t. the general IRC protocol connection
                    happens; or a channel context, which handles channel
                    messages; or a query context, which handles private
                    communication with another user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A context keeps track of what to use as outgoing target
                    when simply entering text at the user interface's
                    provision for user input. A context also can be
                    the basis for /COMMANDs to operate on. As in Irssi,
                    the IRC client, prefixing a line with "/ " (slash, space)
                    will make sure it isn't interpreted as a command
                    even if the rest starts with a slash, too.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    A context can ~grab focus, that is, the implementation
                    of the /join command will see that a suitable context
                    gets created (or reused) and then have the user interface
                    "switch to" that context. This will change the
                    current context of the CLI as by pressing ^O (see below),
                    or switch to the tab that contains the context in the GUI
                    as if pressing Alt-number.

            <li>
                <p>
                    The user interface is built using tab pages.
                    When lines get appended to the tabs,
                    they change color. Black means no change
                    since the last time the tab was current,
                    green means some log buffer contents have been added,
                    red means a highlight has happened.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    For switching tabs easily, the shortcuts Alt-1 to Alt-9
                    can be used (like in the Irssi IRC client in the terminal,
                    but here it's in a GUI,)
                    to switch to windows 1-9, and Alt-0 to switch to window 10.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, an attempt is made to make each tab accessible
                    via Alt plus the first alphabetic character of the tab's
                    first context's name, like Alt-n to switch to a NickServ
                    query, or Alt-f to switch to channel #foo.

            <li>
                <p>
                    For switching channels in the GNU readline-based
                    command-line interface, press ^O (that is, Ctrl-O).
                    This is mostly the same as what Irssi does with ^X.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's possible to supply an "argument" or "count" to the
                    cycle-context function, e.g., press Alt-- ^X (that is,
                    Alt-minus or Esc minus followed by Ctrl-X) to go
                    one step backwards instead of forward.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    "<code>cvnirc-qt-cli -q</code>" will now omit copying
                    the raw IRC protocol lines sent/received to the terminal.
                    That is, the new <code>-q</code>/<code>--quiet</code> mode
                    now silences a few categories of messages, or a whole bunch
                    of lines printed during a normal exchange. This should
                    make it more suited for actually chatting, perhaps.
