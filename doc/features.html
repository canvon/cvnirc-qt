        <h1>Features - cvnirc-qt Manual</h1>

        <h2>cvnirc-gui specific</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The user interface is built using tab pages.
                    When lines get appended to the tabs,
                    they change color. Black means no change
                    since the last time the tab was current,
                    green means some log buffer contents have been added,
                    red means a highlight has happened.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>cvnirc-cli specific</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    For switching channels in the GNU readline-based
                    command-line interface, press ^O (that is, Ctrl-O).
                    This is mostly the same as what Irssi does with ^X.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's possible to supply an "argument" or "count" to the
                    cycle-context function, e.g., press Alt-- ^X (that is,
                    Alt-minus or Esc minus followed by Ctrl-X) to go
                    one step backwards instead of forward.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    "<code>cvnirc-qt-cli -q</code>" will now omit copying
                    the raw IRC protocol lines sent/received to the terminal.
                    That is, the new <code>-q</code>/<code>--quiet</code> mode
                    now silences a few categories of messages, or a whole bunch
                    of lines printed during a normal exchange. This should
                    make it more suited for actually chatting, perhaps.
                </p>
